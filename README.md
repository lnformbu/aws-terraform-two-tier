# **What is AWS 2tier Architecture?**  

AWS **Two-Tier Architecture** is a common setup for web applications in the cloud. It consists of two main layers:  

## **1. Web Server Tier (Frontend)**  

Handles user requests and serves web pages. It includes: 

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers for better performance and availability. AWS offers **Application Load Balancers** and **Network Load Balancers**.

- **Web Servers:** Deliver web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and run dynamic applications (PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.).  

## **2. Database Tier (Backend)**  

Stores and manages application data. It includes:  
- **Database Server:** Hosts data, with AWS options like **RDS, DynamoDB,** and **Aurora**.

- **Storage:** Keeps the data using **EBS, S3,** or **EFS**.  

A **firewall (security group)** separates the two tiers, blocking direct internet access to the database for security. This design improves **scalability, security, and reliability**.  

---

## **Why Use Two-Tier Architecture?**  

- **Scalability:** Web and database layers scale independently—add more servers when needed.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Multiple instances prevent failures from taking down the application.  
- **Security:** The database is isolated and only accessible by authorized sources.  
- **Performance:** Load balancers ensure smooth traffic distribution.  

This setup is **flexible, secure, and optimized for cloud deployments**.

## **Two-Tier vs. Three-Tier Architecture**  

| Architecture  | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| **Two-Tier**  | Client (web) layer communicates **directly** with the database. |
| **Three-Tier** | Adds an **application layer** in between, improving security, scalability, and maintainability. |

Three-tier architecture is better for large applications but more complex and costly to set up.

## **Deploying AWS Two-Tier Architecture with Terraform**  

We'll use **Terraform** (an **Infrastructure as Code** tool) to automate the setup:  

1. **Create a VPC** with public and private subnets.  
2. **Deploy an EC2 instance** (web server) in the public subnet.  
3. **Launch an RDS database** in the private subnet.  
4. **Configure security groups** to allow secure access.  

Terraform makes cloud deployments **fast, repeatable, and efficient** by defining resources in code.  

Let’s build a Two-Tier AWS setup with Terraform.

# **AWS Two-Tier Architecture Components**

This two-tier architecture consists of the following components:

- **VPC:** A Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`.  
- **Public Subnets:** Two subnets (`10.0.0.0/18` and `10.0.64.0/18`), each in a different Availability Zone for high availability.  
- **Private Subnets:** Two subnets (`10.0.128.0/18` and `10.0.192.0/18`), each in a different Availability Zone.  
- **Database Layer:** An **RDS MySQL instance** deployed in a private subnet.  
- **Application Layer:** An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across public subnets.  
- **Compute Layer:** One **EC2 instance** in each public subnet to ensure high availability.  
- **Networking:** An **Internet Gateway** and **Elastic IPs** for public-facing EC2 instances.  

---

## **Prerequisites**  

Before deploying the infrastructure, ensure you have the following:  

- **Terraform CLI** installed  
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials  
- An **AWS Account**  
- A **Code Editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code)  
- **Terraform Registry Reference:** [Terraform AWS Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/)  
- **Terraform Cloud Account** for backend state management.

---

## **Next Steps**  

With these components in place, we will use **Terraform** to automate the deployment of this two-tier architecture in AWS. Let’s begin!  

**Create the following files within your repository to define and manage the AWS two-tier architecture:**

- `provider.tf` – Defines the AWS provider and required configurations.  
- `network.tf` – Sets up the VPC, subnets, and networking components.  
- `compute.tf` – Configures EC2 instances for the application layer.  
- `database.tf` – Provisions an RDS database for persistent storage.  
- `security.tf` – Defines security groups and access controls.  

>> The required terraform configuration for each file can be found in the `terraform` directory.


# **Deploying Your Infrastructure**

Before proceeding, ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured and that you're working from the root directory of your Terraform project.  

## **Step 1: Initialize Terraform**  

To set up your Terraform environment, run:

```bash
terraform init
```

![alt text](img/tfi.png)

 **What Happens When You Run `terraform init`?**  

- **Downloads Provider Plugins** – Ensures Terraform has the necessary AWS provider and any other dependencies.  
- **Sets Up the Backend** – Configures where Terraform will store its state, such as Terraform Cloud or an S3 bucket.  
- **Prepares the Workspace** – Initializes the directory, making it ready for Terraform operations.  

Once the initialization is complete, you can proceed with planning and deploying your infrastructure.  

## **Step 2: Preview the Execution Plan**  

Before applying changes, it's best to see what Terraform intends to do. Run:  

```bash
terraform plan
```

![alt text](img/tfp.png)

![alt text](img/tfc.png)

**What Happens When You Run `terraform plan`?**  

- **Validates the Configuration** – Scans your Terraform files for syntax errors and missing variables.  
- **Identifies Changes** – Compares the current state with the desired state and lists what Terraform will add, modify, or remove.  
- **Provides a Safe Preview** – Displays the expected changes without actually making any modifications to your infrastructure.  

Carefully review the output to confirm that the planned actions align with your expectations before applying the changes.  

## **Step 3: Apply the Configuration**  

Once you've reviewed the plan and confirmed the changes, apply the configuration with:  

```bash
terraform apply
```

**What Happens When You Run `terraform apply`?**  

- **Provisions Infrastructure** – Deploys new resources according to the Terraform configuration.  
- **Updates Existing Resources** – Adjusts any infrastructure that requires modifications to match the desired state.  
- **Executes the Approved Plan** – Ensures only the changes reviewed in `terraform plan` are applied.  

Terraform may ask for confirmation before proceeding. Type **`yes`** to finalize the deployment.

# Verification Steps in AWS Console

To confirm that your VPC and network resources are correctly configured, follow these steps:

## 1. Verify VPC and Subnets

- Go to **AWS Console → VPC Dashboard**
  - Check if the VPC (`lenon-2-tier-vpc`) exists.
  - Ensure that both public and private subnets are created.

## 2. Check Subnet Association

- Go to **AWS Console → RDS → Subnet Groups**
  - Look for `lenon-2-tier-db-sub`.
  - Ensure it has two private subnets (`lenon-2-tier-pvt-sub-1` & `lenon-2-tier-pvt-sub-2`).

## 3. Verify Route Table and Internet Gateway

- Go to **AWS Console → VPC → Route Tables**
  - Ensure public subnets are associated with a route table that has a route to the Internet Gateway (`lenon-2-tier-igw`).
  - Private subnets should not have direct internet access.

## 4. Check Security Groups

- Go to **AWS Console → EC2 → Security Groups**
  - Ensure that:
    - `lenon-2-tier-ec2-sg` allows inbound **HTTP (80)** and **SSH (22)** traffic.
    - `lenon-2-tier-db-sg` allows **MySQL (3306)** connections only from EC2 instances inside the VPC.

## 5. Confirm DB Parameter Group

- Go to **AWS Console → RDS → Parameter Groups**
  - If using `default.mysql5.7`, check if it exists.
  - If using a custom parameter group, ensure it’s created and assigned to the RDS instance.
